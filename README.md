## Idea
Candler is a small story art-game in which you will be told a story about a traveler who lights all the lanterns on his way.
## Game
The story takes place in a dark world where no life can exist without light. You play as a lantern, which gives light in different regions of this world and brings life back there.
Interaction with the lanterns will take place in the form of a mini-game, where you will need to quickly type the first words of the continuation of the story. The words that the player has to type will appear at the bottom of the screen, and below them will be a timer with time. If you type the wrong letter, it will be considered a mistake and the time will be reduced. If the player does not have time to type the word, nothing will happen and the player will have to move on. Otherwise, the player will shed light on the area and learn part of the story, which will be highlighted as subtitles below.
